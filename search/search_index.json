See the latest news from our group. Plant disease epidemics cause major economic shocks and reductions in food production. Epidemics can be especially harmful in developing countries where communities are often highly dependant on agriculture for subsistence and household income.

Our models are used to predict the spread of disease and to identify and optimise economically and ecologically sustainable strategies for disease management, encompassing genetical, chemical, biological and cultural methods. The research involves a synthesis of epidemiological theory, population and evolutionary genetics, landscape ecology and economic modelling. The models are tested using data from extensive field and regional data-sets. Food Security Plant pests and disease pose a significant threat to global food security. Accurate predictions of how pest and pathogens will spread are vital for the planning and efficient control of such threats. Using a range of mathematical and statistical methods we are developing models that can forecast where the pathogen/pest is likely to occur and how rapidly it will spread and cause losses once introduced in a given location. These models take into account the environmental suitability of the host landscape as well as the epidemiological dynamics of the pathogen. Such forecasts can be used to help identify strategies that will reduce the risk of spread and to determine optimal monitoring schemes. These types of models are been used by members of the group to predict the spread of new strains of wheat stem rust in Africa, cassava mosaic virus (CMV) and cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) in sub-saharan Africa, bean viruses in Africa and citrus greening (HLB) in the USA. Diseases in the Natural Environment The natural environment is under increasing pressure from pests and pathogens. Examples include sudden oak death in USA and Chalara ash dieback, Phythophthora ramorum and Oak processionary moth in the UK. We are developing models to determine the optimal control strategies to minimise the impact out such pest/pathogen outbreaks. In particular, such models take into account the economic costs as well as the damage to the natural environment caused by pest/pathogen invasion. Crop Modelling We are also applying mathematical and statistical techniques to model canopy expansion and crop nitrogen uptake in relation to nitrogen supply and temperature. This work is part of the N-Circle project. Communication Activities Our group has undertaken a number of outreach activities both with stakeholders and the wider public. Examples include: Cambridge Science Festival, London Science museum lates and development of a web-based interface to illustrate impacts of disease control. Experimentation Page (This is outdated as of before I started my PhD) The group is involved with a broad spectrum of experimental work on the dynamics and control of epidemics. We work at a range of scales that extend from: the spread of fungal colonies through soil; pathozone dynamics and disease transmission between individual plants; disease spread through plant populations using microcosms; large scale field experiments. The experimental programme is designed: to answer specific questions about the epidemiology and control of soil-borne plant disease; to use these plant systems as experimental models to test hypotheses about more generic epidemiological mechanisms that control the spatial and temporal dynamics and efficiency of control in a broad range of pathogens including aerial pathogens and certain animal and even human diseases. Modelling Page Current modelling work encompasses epidemiological theory, population genetics, landscape ecology and economic modelling. The principal challenge is to capture the essential feature of a complicated biological system, such as an epidemic, in a sufficiently rigorous mathematical formulation that allows us to analyse the spatial and temporal dynamics of the system in order to understand: why do epidemics occur? how do they spread? why are they so variable? why does disease occur in some regions and not in others? how can we move from understanding small-scale phenomena at the level of the plant or patch to the larger-scale of epidemic at the field or region? and how can we improve the efficiency of control? This involves a range of modelling approaches, mathematical techniques and statistical techniques. Modelling approaches These cover a spectrum that includes the following. Temporal models are mostly based on compartmental SEIR(Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed) models for epidemics but with additional complexities of: dual sources of inoculum; quenching as hosts become resistant to infection; and host dynamics that depend upon infection load. Stochastic modelsinclude allowance for: demographic stochasticity (chance effects in transmission from infected to susceptible individuals under otherwise identical conditions); environmental stochasticity (when transmission parameters are influenced by local or global changes in environmental variables). Spatially-implicit modelsseek to capture some of the spatial aspects of epidemics within a temporal model by using: non-linear mixing terms between susceptibles and infected; moment closure and pair-approximation methods. Spatially-explicit modelsinclude: individual-based models, for example, for susceptibles on a lattice often with local mixing; reaction-advection-diffusion and dispersal-kernel models; metapopulation models that comprise coupled sub-populations such as fields or different regions. Mathematical techniques The group uses a range of mathematical techniques to model epidemic and other ecological processes. These include: ordinary and partial differential equations including asymptotic and perturbation theory for model reduction; stochastic differential equations; probability theory; individual-based models for spatial epidemics; optimisation and control theory; percolation theory and other methods from statistical physics. Statistical techniques One of the principal characteristics of the group s work is the close interaction between modelling, experimentation and statistical inference to test models and to estimate epidemiological parameters. We are particularly interested in the role of error structure in epidemic dynamics and in the estimation of variance and higher moments. Examples of recent and current work include: Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to estimate parameters for spatio-temporal models of epidemics; Bayesian methods to estimate parameters for replicate epidemics with treatment effects; Bayesian methods to estimate parameters for stochastic compartmental models; Likelihood methods for estimation of a range of epidemiological parameters. Links with experimentation and testing models against data The mathematical and experimental programmes are strongly linked. For example, theoretical work on the consequences of seasonality for epidemics in agricultural crops is accompanied by experiments on R. solani infecting radish seedlings in easily-controllable microcosms. Similarly, modelling of the growth of fungi in soil evolves in concert with the experimental techniques in soil physics to control the spatial structures through which micro-organisms spread along with techniques which make it possible to visualise fungi in that environment. Other work on the regional spread of diseases, draw on extensive field data from collaborating organisations and our own archives.

The research involves a synthesis of epidemiological theory, population and evolutionary genetics, landscape ecology and economic modelling. The models are tested using data from extensive field and regional data-sets. Food Security Plant pests and disease pose a significant threat to global food security. Accurate predictions of how pest and pathogens will spread are vital for the planning and efficient control of such threats. Using a range of mathematical and statistical methods we are developing models that can forecast where the pathogen/pest is likely to occur and how rapidly it will spread and cause losses once introduced in a given location. These models take into account the environmental suitability of the host landscape as well as the epidemiological dynamics of the pathogen. Such forecasts can be used to help identify strategies that will reduce the risk of spread and to determine optimal monitoring schemes. These types of models are been used by members of the group to predict the spread of new strains of wheat stem rust in Africa, cassava mosaic virus (CMV) and cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) in sub-saharan Africa, bean viruses in Africa and citrus greening (HLB) in the USA. Diseases in the Natural Environment The natural environment is under increasing pressure from pests and pathogens. Examples include sudden oak death in USA and Chalara ash dieback, Phythophthora ramorum and Oak processionary moth in the UK. We are developing models to determine the optimal control strategies to minimise the impact out such pest/pathogen outbreaks. In particular, such models take into account the economic costs as well as the damage to the natural environment caused by pest/pathogen invasion. Crop Modelling We are also applying mathematical and statistical techniques to model canopy expansion and crop nitrogen uptake in relation to nitrogen supply and temperature. This work is part of the N-Circle project. Communication Activities Our group has undertaken a number of outreach activities both with stakeholders and the wider public. Examples include: Cambridge Science Festival, London Science museum lates and development of a web-based interface to illustrate impacts of disease control.","title":"Main page"},{"location":"archive/OldWebsite/#experimentation-page","text":"(This is outdated as of before I started my PhD) The group is involved with a broad spectrum of experimental work on the dynamics and control of epidemics. We work at a range of scales that extend from: the spread of fungal colonies through soil; pathozone dynamics and disease transmission between individual plants; disease spread through plant populations using microcosms; large scale field experiments. The experimental programme is designed: to answer specific questions about the epidemiology and control of soil-borne plant disease; to use these plant systems as experimental models to test hypotheses about more generic epidemiological mechanisms that control the spatial and temporal dynamics and efficiency of control in a broad range of pathogens including aerial pathogens and certain animal and even human diseases.","title":"Experimentation Page"},{"location":"archive/OldWebsite/#modelling-page","text":"Current modelling work encompasses epidemiological theory, population genetics, landscape ecology and economic modelling.

Temporal models are mostly based on compartmental SEIR(Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed) models for epidemics but with additional complexities of: dual sources of inoculum; quenching as hosts become resistant to infection; and host dynamics that depend upon infection load. Stochastic modelsinclude allowance for: demographic stochasticity (chance effects in transmission from infected to susceptible individuals under otherwise identical conditions); environmental stochasticity (when transmission parameters are influenced by local or global changes in environmental variables). Spatially-implicit modelsseek to capture some of the spatial aspects of epidemics within a temporal model by using: non-linear mixing terms between susceptibles and infected; moment closure and pair-approximation methods.

Pests and pathogenic spores can be channelled by air streams over long distances, crossing international boundaries and continents, bringing severe consequences for crop production and livelihoods in previously uninfected geographical areas. Forecasting risks of invasion at continental scale, requires simulation models and visualization tools for estimating pest dispersal, range and intensity (spore or insect load), to forewarn national plant health agencies and enable contingency plans to be implemented in advance. The challenge is the quantity of data that are involved for interpretation and visualization of spatiotemporal dynamics of atmospheric transport of crop pathogens and insect pests, requiring tools that are capable of processing the data in a reasonable time, so that pest and disease warnings can be rapidly disseminated to regional plant health authorities, government agencies and extension services, in countries at risk. Our team has explored how 3-D visualization technologies can link time-dependant meteorological data to atmospheric transport models to produce 3-D visual representations of pest and disease movements at regional and continental scales. Cassava Responsive Location: Sub-Saharan Africa Developing a predictive model for an emerging epidemic on cassava in sub\u2011Saharan Africa Cassava showing symptoms of cassava brown streak disease in leaves and tubers caused by infections of ipomoviruses. Cassava (Manihot esculenta) is one of the most important staple food crops produced globally, primarily grown in low-input subsistence farming systems in the tropics and subtropics. In Africa alone, an estimated 800 million people rely on cassava for their primary calorific intake. Cassava brown streak disease was first reported in Uganda in 2004 but has since been detected widely across countries in East and Central Africa, now reaching as far as the north central districts in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Continued westward expansion is now a significant threat to food security and economic stability in the major cassava-producing regions of Central and West Africa. Threatening food production In recent years cassava production in sub-Saharan Africa has come under increasing pressure due to the rapidly expanding range of cassava brown streak disease (Figure 1). The disease, which causes necrosis of the edible root tissue infected by ipomoviruses, can be transmitted across cassava-growing regions in two ways. Firstly, vectored by Bemisia whitefly, which feed on the aerial tissues of infected plants causing cross contamination within and between field crops. Secondly, through human movement of virus-infected propagated cuttings that are traded, transported and planted for the next season\u2019s harvest. Predicting epidemics Maps representing the rasterised data-driven model layers: (A) the model cassava landscape, representing the number of fields at a 1 km2 resolution derived from the digital resource, CassavaMap. Testing the model by (B) simulating the spread of cassava brown streak disease using data from 2004 to predict its range in 2017, versus (C) the actual survey data collected in 2017 from the Ugandan field surveys. Landscape models capable of predicting where and when cassava brown streak disease will occur in a new region are essential tools for ensuring that national strategies can be prepared to mitigate the threat to cassava production areas. Epidemiology and Modelling Group focus on key questions to address challenges faced by national decision makers i) when will the virus cross international borders to arrive in unaffected countries in West Africa; ii) how can these disease-free countries optimise surveillance for early detection and be ready for outbreaks and iii) what strategies can the increasing number of disease-endemic countries use to minimise the impact on farm businesses and food security? Accurately predicting the arrival of a crop pest or pathogen over large regions in sub-Sahara Africa is extremely challenging due to the complexity of crop landscapes within and between countries. In a recent study, members of the Cambridge team used surveillance data for cassava brown streak disease collected by colleagues in Uganda, to design and validate a stochastic epidemic model of the virus, as it spread to new districts. The new model provided a framework for analysing the spread of cassava brown streak disease (Figure below), taking into account the variation in the distribution of the cassava fields and the prevalence of the whitefly vector across the Ugandan landscape. Developing a model framework for future management strategies Moreover, the research team designed the model to simulate the impact of planting virus-free cassava cuttings (clean seed programme) in localised areas around Kampala, and were able to demonstrate its use for predicting and analysing the impacts of disease-management scenarios. Gaining an insight into the regions threatened by epidemic outbreaks of cassava brown streak disease is key in supporting the chain of events that will ensure timely guidance and resources are available to agencies and farmers to minimise the risk of crop losses.

Smallholder farmers have sourced clean seed material, which is 100% virus free, to start growing the initial field. All plants produce new suckers from the field are planted to replenish initial field or to expand production into new fields. Sustainable strategy Running generated simulations we can provide evidence that introducing virus-free material in areas affected by BBTV along with propagation of suckers combined with plant inspection for infection and removal of infected plants can provide a sustainable strategy for disease management. Models were validated using field data from Omondi et al. 2020, Plant Pathology, 69, 1754. The benefits This model could be adapted to be used for other hosts and pathogens. We are able to include additional management options (continuous provision of clean-seed, pesticide treatment) into the model which increases model robustness and accuracy for determining the benefits of introducing clean seed programmes under different farming systems.
