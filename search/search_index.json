Applications range from large-scale pandemics (sudden oak death, citrus canker, African cassava mosaic virus), through pesticide resistance and genetical control to biocontrol in sustainable agricultural systems, and to the design of intervention strategies for exotic pathogen threats to the UK. The research involves a synthesis of epidemiological theory, population and evolutionary genetics, landscape ecology and economic modelling, drawing upon methods from statistical physics and Bayesian statistical inference, supported by a complementary experimental programme involving laboratory microcosms and collation of extensive field and regional data-sets to test the models. For more details, please visit the departmental website. Lawrence Bower Scientific IT Developer lb584@cam.ac.uk Providing scientific programming support for large-scale epidemiological forecasting programmes. Currently contributing to an on-going wheat rust collaborative project which provides current predictions for long-distance dispersal pathways of wheat rust spores across Africa, the Middle East and Asia. Areas of expertise include Pipelines, HPC, plotting and user interfaces. Dr Ruairi Donnelly Postdoc rd501@cam.ac.uk ORCID Google Scholar My research interests lie in ecology, epidemiology and evolution. At present I study the dynamics of a number of plant arboviruses. These include those that are \"non-persistently\" transmitted by aphids, as well as several important viruses of cassava that are transmitted by whitefly (cassava mosaic virus, cassava brown streak virus). I collaborate on empirical and modelling research with colleagues in the molecular plant pathology group of Prof. John Carr (Plant Sciences, Cambridge), and on field experiments in East Africa with colleagues at BecA ILRI (Nairobi). Sally Hames Group Administrator and PA sah57@cam.ac.uk Dr Tamas Mona Postdoc tm689@cam.ac.uk ORCID Working as a weather modeller in the wheat rust forecasting project which is a collaboration between the Epidemiology and Modelling Group at the University of Cambridge, the UK Met Office, CIMMYT (International Maize and Wheat Improvement Centre) and the Ethiopian Institute of Agricultural Research. The project uses NAME to forecast the spread of these epidemics of wheat rust in near real-time to enable growers to take preventative action. The project grew from an initial analysis of pathways for long-distance dispersal of wheat rust spores extending from Southern and East Africa through the Middle East, West and South Asia. Dr Renata Retkute Postdoc rr614@cam.ac.uk ORCID My research has focused on modelling and parametrisation of biological systems at different spatial and temporal scales, based on the experimental and observed data. Dr Alison Scott-Brown as3237@cam.ac.uk A current member of the Epidemiology and Modelling Group, promoting research impact with relevance to food security, plant biosecurity and biodiversity across regions in Sub-Saharan Africa, South Asia, Europe and UK. Additionally, collating science impact for an international food security programme, TIGR2ESS, across the six interdisciplinary flagship projects (India and UK).Research Interests Plant-insect interactions, using thrips as a model to unravel questions on host-plant selection, tolerance and resistance to invasive species. More recently focusing on mechanisms underpinning beneficial interactions (pollinating and predatory thrips), accumulating knowledge on benefits these bring in natural and agricultural settings. Dr Jacob Smith Postdoc jws52@cam.ac.uk ORCID With a background in climate science, I want to improve understanding of plant diseases dispersed by the wind. Wheat crops often suffer from wheat rust, a family of aerially dispersed fungal pathogens. Similarly, wheat blast is an emerging threat. Key to mitigating their impacts is the research and development of models equipped with appropriate processes, including Lagrangian dispersal models and full-landscape epidemiological models. In collaboration with others, my research brings these aspects together. Dr Yevhen Suprunenko Postdoc ys526@cam.ac.uk Using methods of mathematics and physics I study complex dynamics of living organisms. I am fascinated with how living systems and groups of living organisms maintain their function and their existence, despite being open systems and being subject to continuous perturbations and fluctuations. In my research, I develop models and theoretical descriptions of such dynamics, focusing on underlying mechanisms, and on the role of spatially explicit dynamics, stochasticity, and time-variability. I received my PhD in Theoretical Physics (2011, Lancaster University, UK). Before joining Epidemiology and Modelling group of Prof Chris Gilligan, I worked as a postdoc in Nonlinear and Biomedical Physics (2011-2014, and 2017-2018, Lancaster University, UK), and in Theoretical Ecology (2014 \u2013 2017, University of Liverpool). Dr Rich Stutt Postdoc rs481@cam.ac.uk ORCID My research is focused on large scale predictions for disease spread and management. Current Projects My current projects involve modelling the spread of the Ramorum disease epidemic (also known as Sudden Oak Death, caused by P. ramorum) in the UK, working with regulators to provide outputs including predictions of disease spread and the effect of management strategies. I am also involved in predicting the potential for future spread of Sudden Oak Death on the east coast of the USA, and looking at the effects of spread of citrus diseases at the state scale in Florida. I am part of the production and deployment of a web based interactive utility to demonstrate the effect of control in realistic landscapes and additionally the development of a generic computational framework for stochastic simulation of spatial models of epidemics and developing a flexible, computationally-efficient suite of models for the analysis of disease spread and control in heterogeneous environments. Dr Cerian Webb Postdoc crw1005@cam.ac.uk ORCID I am a Mathematical Epidemiologist with a background in both plant and animal systems. I received a degree in Pure Mathematics from the University of York (1992) an MSc in Mathematical Biology from the University of Dundee (1993) and a PhD modelling crop growth and disease dynamics from the Department of Plant Sciences, University of Cambridge under the supervision of Professor Chris Gilligan and Dr Rik Werker. After completing my PhD I joined the veterinary epidemiology group at VLA-Weybridge where I developed models to investigate the dynamics of scrapie and likely efficacy of control policies. I have contributed to disease modelling internationally through involvement in an EU transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) project and collaborations with Massey University, New Zealand. In 2000 I moved back to the University of Cambridge, although this time to the Vet School, as the Kirsten Rausing Research Fellow which enabled me to pursue more theoretical work investigating the role of animal movement networks in determining the dynamics of farm animal disease. Having taken a break from research (but not from lecturing and teaching) while my daughter went through primary school, I have found myself back in Plant Sciences where I work on mathematical models for a range of tree pests and pathogens. In addition to my research role, I lecture for the Part 1A Mathematical Biology course and am a lecturer on the Wellcome Trust 'Mathematical Models for Infectious Disease Dynamics' course. I regularly deliver courses on MATLAB for Biologists and have recently co-authored the textbook \u201cIntroduction to MATLAB for Biologists\u201d. As well as my research position in this group I am the Associate Lecturer in Mathematical Biology for Newnham College, Cambridge.

Our models are used to predict the spread of disease and to identify and optimise economically and ecologically sustainable strategies for disease management, encompassing genetical, chemical, biological and cultural methods. The research involves a synthesis of epidemiological theory, population and evolutionary genetics, landscape ecology and economic modelling. The models are tested using data from extensive field and regional data-sets. Food Security Plant pests and disease pose a significant threat to global food security. Accurate predictions of how pest and pathogens will spread are vital for the planning and efficient control of such threats. Using a range of mathematical and statistical methods we are developing models that can forecast where the pathogen/pest is likely to occur and how rapidly it will spread and cause losses once introduced in a given location. These models take into account the environmental suitability of the host landscape as well as the epidemiological dynamics of the pathogen. Such forecasts can be used to help identify strategies that will reduce the risk of spread and to determine optimal monitoring schemes. These types of models are been used by members of the group to predict the spread of new strains of wheat stem rust in Africa, cassava mosaic virus (CMV) and cassava brown streak virus (CBSV) in sub-saharan Africa, bean viruses in Africa and citrus greening (HLB) in the USA. Diseases in the Natural Environment The natural environment is under increasing pressure from pests and pathogens. Examples include sudden oak death in USA and Chalara ash dieback, Phythophthora ramorum and Oak processionary moth in the UK. We are developing models to determine the optimal control strategies to minimise the impact out such pest/pathogen outbreaks. In particular, such models take into account the economic costs as well as the damage to the natural environment caused by pest/pathogen invasion. Crop Modelling We are also applying mathematical and statistical techniques to model canopy expansion and crop nitrogen uptake in relation to nitrogen supply and temperature. This work is part of the N-Circle project. Communication Activities Our group has undertaken a number of outreach activities both with stakeholders and the wider public. Examples include: Cambridge Science Festival, London Science museum lates and development of a web-based interface to illustrate impacts of disease control. Experimentation Page (This is outdated as of before I started my PhD) The group is involved with a broad spectrum of experimental work on the dynamics and control of epidemics. We work at a range of scales that extend from: the spread of fungal colonies through soil; pathozone dynamics and disease transmission between individual plants; disease spread through plant populations using microcosms; large scale field experiments. The experimental programme is designed: to answer specific questions about the epidemiology and control of soil-borne plant disease; to use these plant systems as experimental models to test hypotheses about more generic epidemiological mechanisms that control the spatial and temporal dynamics and efficiency of control in a broad range of pathogens including aerial pathogens and certain animal and even human diseases. Modelling Page Current modelling work encompasses epidemiological theory, population genetics, landscape ecology and economic modelling. The principal challenge is to capture the essential feature of a complicated biological system, such as an epidemic, in a sufficiently rigorous mathematical formulation that allows us to analyse the spatial and temporal dynamics of the system in order to understand: why do epidemics occur? how do they spread? why are they so variable? why does disease occur in some regions and not in others? how can we move from understanding small-scale phenomena at the level of the plant or patch to the larger-scale of epidemic at the field or region? and how can we improve the efficiency of control? This involves a range of modelling approaches, mathematical techniques and statistical techniques. Modelling approaches These cover a spectrum that includes the following. Temporal models are mostly based on compartmental SEIR(Susceptible, Exposed, Infected and Removed) models for epidemics but with additional complexities of: dual sources of inoculum; quenching as hosts become resistant to infection; and host dynamics that depend upon infection load. Stochastic modelsinclude allowance for: demographic stochasticity (chance effects in transmission from infected to susceptible individuals under otherwise identical conditions); environmental stochasticity (when transmission parameters are influenced by local or global changes in environmental variables). Spatially-implicit modelsseek to capture some of the spatial aspects of epidemics within a temporal model by using: non-linear mixing terms between susceptibles and infected; moment closure and pair-approximation methods. Spatially-explicit modelsinclude: individual-based models, for example, for susceptibles on a lattice often with local mixing; reaction-advection-diffusion and dispersal-kernel models; metapopulation models that comprise coupled sub-populations such as fields or different regions. Mathematical techniques The group uses a range of mathematical techniques to model epidemic and other ecological processes. These include: ordinary and partial differential equations including asymptotic and perturbation theory for model reduction; stochastic differential equations; probability theory; individual-based models for spatial epidemics; optimisation and control theory; percolation theory and other methods from statistical physics. Statistical techniques One of the principal characteristics of the group s work is the close interaction between modelling, experimentation and statistical inference to test models and to estimate epidemiological parameters. We are particularly interested in the role of error structure in epidemic dynamics and in the estimation of variance and higher moments. Examples of recent and current work include: Markov chain Monte Carlo techniques to estimate parameters for spatio-temporal models of epidemics; Bayesian methods to estimate parameters for replicate epidemics with treatment effects; Bayesian methods to estimate parameters for stochastic compartmental models; Likelihood methods for estimation of a range of epidemiological parameters. Links with experimentation and testing models against data The mathematical and experimental programmes are strongly linked. For example, theoretical work on the consequences of seasonality for epidemics in agricultural crops is accompanied by experiments on R. solani infecting radish seedlings in easily-controllable microcosms. Similarly, modelling of the growth of fungi in soil evolves in concert with the experimental techniques in soil physics to control the spatial structures through which micro-organisms spread along with techniques which make it possible to visualise fungi in that environment. Other work on the regional spread of diseases, draw on extensive field data from collaborating organisations and our own archives. Current and previous examples include: Rhizomania disease of sugar beet Dutch elm disease Citrus canker disease Fungicide resistance Biological control of Sclerotinia disease Bubonic plague Seal distemper disease control of Rhizoct.","title":"OldWebsite"},{"location":"archive/OldWebsite/#old-pages","text":"","title":"Old pages"},{"location":"archive/OldWebsite/#main-page","text":"Head of Group: Professor Chris Gilligan Chris Gilligan Our research is focused on developing and testing a theoretical framework to understand the mechanisms that control invasion, persistence, scaling and variability of epidemics within changing agricultural and natural landscapes.
